### RequestCollector

[The RequestCollector](https://github.com/morawskim/request-collector) is library to collect the request/response sent via Symfony HttpClient or Guzzle.

The idea to create this library was resolve many issues with external integrations due to missing data during tests, incomplete/different configuration between sandbox and production system or difficulties to test some scenarios. The goal of this library is to help debugging those integrations even on production environments. Each sent request and response can be logged and sanitized from private/personal data.

### PHP Profiler

[php-profiler](https://github.com/morawskim/php-profiler-monorepo) is split into two packages. One package php-profiler is used to profile PHP code and does not include any external dependencies and support legacy PHP versions (7.2+).

The other package php-profiler-cli is used to analyse profiler data created by php-profiler package. Because analyse process does not run on production environment this library requires external dependencies and might require modern PHP version.
